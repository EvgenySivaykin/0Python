Sure! Let me explain the code step by step:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```python
import requests
```
- This imports the `requests` module, which is used to send HTTP requests in Python.

---

```python
def fetch_todos():
```
- Defines a function named `fetch_todos` that will fetch the TODOs from the API.

---

```python
    url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"
```
- Stores the API endpoint URL in the `url` variable. This API provides fake TODO data.

---

```python
    response = requests.get(url)
```
- Sends a **GET** request to the API and stores the response in the `response` variable.

---

```python
    if response.status_code == 200:
```
- Checks if the response status code is `200`, which means the request was **successful**.

---

```python
        todos = response.json()
```
- Converts the JSON response data into a Python list of dictionaries and stores it in `todos`.

---

```python
        for todo in todos[:10]:
```
- Loops through the **first 10 TODO items** (`todos[:10]` means "get only the first 10 elements").

---

```python
            print(f"ID: {todo['id']}, Title: {todo['title']}, Completed: {todo['completed']}")
```
- For each TODO item, it prints:
  - `ID`
  - `Title`
  - `Completed` status (True/False)

---

```python
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data. Status code:", response.status_code)
```
- If the API request fails (status code is **not** 200), it prints an error message with the actual status code.

---

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_todos()
```
- This ensures that the function `fetch_todos()` runs only if the script is executed directly.
- It prevents the function from running if the script is imported into another module.

---

### **Example Output:**
If the API request is successful, the script prints something like:

```
ID: 1, Title: delectus aut autem, Completed: False
ID: 2, Title: quis ut nam facilis et officia qui, Completed: False
ID: 3, Title: fugiat veniam minus, Completed: False
ID: 4, Title: et porro tempora, Completed: True
...
```
